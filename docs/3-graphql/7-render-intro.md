After creating our query and tested it out in GraphiQL, we can start thinking about rendering the data.

To render our data, we have 2 or 2.5 options:

- PageQuery
- StaticQuery
- useStaticQuery (hook) added with React hooks came out

Most likely for all your static queries you will use useStaticQuery hoot. However, learn to use the other 2 in case you run in to them in someone else's project.
